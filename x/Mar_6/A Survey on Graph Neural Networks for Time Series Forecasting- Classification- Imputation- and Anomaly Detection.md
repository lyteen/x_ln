You're welcome! Is there anything specific you'd like me to elaborate on or explore further regarding GNNs and time series analysis?  I can discuss:

*   **Specific Applications:**  For instance, delve deeper into GNNs in traffic forecasting, anomaly detection in IoT, or wind energy prediction.
*   **Technical Details:** Focus on the nuances of different GNN architectures (e.g., spectral vs. spatial GNNs) and their impact on time series modeling.
*   **Current Research Trends:**  Discuss emerging research areas, like few-shot learning, transfer learning with time series, or graph learning in non-stationary environments.
*   **Code and Datasets:**  Discuss the common benchmarks and code used in GNN4TS to help future research development.

Just let me know what you're interested in!
