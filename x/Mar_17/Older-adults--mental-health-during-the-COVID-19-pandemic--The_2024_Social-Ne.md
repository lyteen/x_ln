**Abstract:** This study examined the impact of different social networks on the mental health outcomes of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 25,534 older adults from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The study identified five social network profiles (family, friends, spouse, diverse, others) and a "no network" group. Findings showed that, compared to the no network profile, those with spouse and family profiles are more protected against depression and loneliness during the COVID-19. In turn, individuals within friends and diverse profiles had a similar likelihood of feeling depressed, anxious, and lonely. Friends and diverse profiles had higher likelihood of suffering more anxious or lonelier than before the COVID-19 compared to the no network profile. The study further discusses possible explanations about why these profiles, which typically served as mental health protectors, were significantly affected by the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.

        本研究探讨了 COVID-19 大流行期间不同社会网络对老年人心理健康结果的影响。参与者为来自欧洲健康、老龄化和退休调查 (SHARE) 的 25,534 名老年人。研究确定了五种社会网络概况（家庭、朋友、配偶、多元、其他）和一个“无网络”组。研究结果表明，与无网络概况相比，拥有配偶和家庭概况的人在 COVID-19 期间更能免受抑郁和孤独的侵袭。反过来，朋友和多元概况中的个体感到抑郁、焦虑和孤独的可能性相似。与无网络概况相比，朋友和多元概况更有可能遭受更多的焦虑或比 COVID-19 之前更孤独。该研究进一步讨论了为什么这些通常作为心理健康保护者的概况受到 COVID-19 大流行的独特环境的显著影响的可能解释。

**Main Methods:**

1.  **Latent Profile Analysis (LPA):** Used to identify social support typologies based on eight variables related to social network composition and dynamics.
2.  **Multilevel Binary Logistic Regression:** Employed to regress mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, loneliness) on social network types, controlling for socio-demographic and pandemic-specific variables. Country was included as a between-level variable.

**Main Contributions:**

1.  **Identified distinct social network profiles among older adults in Europe and Israel:** The study identified five profiles: family, friends, spouse, diverse, and others, plus a "no network" group.
2.  **Examined the association between social network profiles and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic:** It showed that spouse and family profiles were protective against depression and loneliness compared to the "no network" group.
3.  **Revealed the vulnerability of friends and diverse profiles during the pandemic:** Individuals within these profiles were more likely to experience increased anxiety and loneliness compared to before the pandemic.
4.  **Discussed possible explanations for the differential impact of the pandemic on different social network profiles:** Highlighted the potential for family networks to become sources of stress and for the pandemic to disrupt social interaction for those with friends and diverse profiles.
5.  **Provided insights for adapting support programs for older adults during crises:** Emphasized the need to consider the specific needs of different network profiles when designing interventions to mitigate the negative mental health impacts of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.
